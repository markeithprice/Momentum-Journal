    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-column SPA. Left sidebar for navigation (category filters, search, randomizer button) and a list of filtered prompts. Right main area to display the full selected journal prompt. This structure allows users to easily navigate the large list of 210 prompts, either by targeted filtering or serendipitous randomization, making the content highly accessible and usable as a daily tool. The layout will be responsive, stacking on mobile devices. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The primary content is textual journal prompts. Goal: Inform/Guide. Method: Structured HTML updated via Vanilla JS. Interaction: Users select a category, which filters a list of prompts. Clicking a prompt displays its details. A randomizer offers a prompt of the day. A search bar allows keyword filtering. Justification: This interactive filtering and display system turns a long, static document into a dynamic, user-driven application, fulfilling the core objective. Library: Vanilla JS for all logic and DOM manipulation. Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
